Create a full-stack JavaScript web application prototype for a Syrian government NGO platform.

IMPORTANT:
This project must use a TEMPORARY DUMMY AUTHENTICATION system.
Auth should be implemented in a way that can be easily replaced later by Auth0, Clerk, or any external auth provider.

TECH STACK:
- Next.js (JavaScript, NOT TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js API routes
- Workiom as database (via REST API)
- Cookie-based or JWT-based dummy auth
- RTL Arabic layout

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
An official Syrian government NGO platform where organizations can register and manage their NGO information, and admins can review and approve entries.

PAGES REQUIRED:

1) PUBLIC LANDING PAGE
- Arabic language
- RTL layout
- Green government theme
- Header navigation:
  - الرئيسية
  - عن المنصة
  - المنظمات
  - تسجيل الدخول
- Clean, official government layout

2) LOGIN / SIGNUP PAGE (DUMMY AUTH)
- Username
- Password
- No third-party auth
- Users stored in Workiom or local mock data
- On login:
  - Create a session token or JWT
  - Store role (user / admin)

3) USER DASHBOARD (Protected)
- Accessible only when logged in
- User can:
  - Add a new NGO
  - View list of NGOs they created
  - Edit existing NGOs
- NGO fields:
  - NGO Name
  - City
  - President Name
  - Contact Email
  - Contact Phone
  - Description
  - Status (Pending / Approved / Rejected – read only for users)

4) ADMIN PANEL (Protected, Admin Only)
- Separate route
- View all NGOs
- Filter by status
- Approve or reject NGOs
- Edit NGO information
- Admin role should be controlled via dummy role flag

DATABASE (Workiom):
- NGOs table:
  - id

  - presidentName
  - email
  - phone
  - description
  - status
  - createdBy
- Users table (for dummy auth):
  - id
  - username
  - password (plain text for prototype only)
  - role

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Match Syrian government website style:
  - Green primary color
  - White background
- RTL everywhere
- Formal Arabic tone
- Layout similar to official ministry websites

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Axios for Workiom API calls
- Use middleware to protect routes
- Separate auth logic into:
  /lib/auth.js
- Use reusable auth guards so real auth can replace dummy auth later
- Use environment variables for Workiom keys

DELIVERABLES:
- Functional UI
- Working dummy authentication
- CRUD operations for NGOs
- Admin review workflow
- Clear comments explaining where to replace auth later
